# Spotify-Project
## Project Description
Spotify is a leading music streaming service that provides millions of tracks to users worldwide. The company operates with two models: a free model and a premium model, offering both ad-supported and premium subscription services.
## Used Tools (Excel, Tableau)
## The Goal
To provide a comprehensive solution that enables Spotify’s leadership to make informed decisions on revenue growth, user engagement, and cost optimization.
## Key Points and Insights
- **To meet Mark’s requirements, who is Director of Revenue**, we created a visualization titled "Change of Total Revenue (Premium Revenue, Profit, etc.) over time." This visualization shows a positive trend over the years.
Total revenue increased from $902 in 2017 to $3,166 in 2023. Premium revenue has also shown a strong positive trend since 2017.
Ad revenue fluctuates the most over the years but still maintains a positive long-term trend.
Ad Cost of Revenue stands at $5,042, directly impacting profitability.
Ad Revenue Efficiency is below 1 in some quarters, such as Q1 2023 (0.97), indicating that costs exceed revenues—therefore, optimization is necessary to achieve positive returns.<br>
Recommendations:
Increase ad frequency (e.g., more ads per hour) without losing users.
Conduct A/B testing to compare longer vs. shorter ads and find optimal formats for revenue growth.
Reduce costs and improve efficiency.
Increase revenue through Premium subscriptions by:
Testing dynamic pricing and adjusting prices based on regions (e.g., lower prices in emerging markets).
Offering longer trial periods for new users (e.g., 3-month free trials for highly engaged segments).
Reducing churn by offering personalized retention campaigns for users at risk of cancellation.
Introducing loyalty programs for long-term subscribers.
The ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) ranges between 4 and 6 from 2017 to 2023, with some fluctuations but remaining relatively stable overall.
In Q1 2023, ARPU was 4, indicating a slight decline compared to previous years.
Premium strategy adjustments are advised—consider regional price increases where appropriate and introduce additional features for higher-tier subscription plans.
- **User Growth Trends (for Sarah, Head of Strategy)**
Sarah focuses on long-term growth and strategic alignment. She is interested in user growth trends, particularly among Premium and ad-supported users, to shape future strategies.
The "MAUs over time" chart shows a clear upward trend in Monthly Active Users (MAUs) from 2017 to 2023, with average values significantly exceeded in recent years.<br>
Recommendations for Sarah:
Investigate which marketing campaigns or product improvements contributed most to MAU growth—this will require additional data collection.
Ad MAUs are growing faster than Premium MAUs, indicating a user preference for the free version, likely due to lower willingness to pay initially.
Despite the larger number of Ad MAUs, Premium MAUs generate significantly more revenue.
Strategy: Convert a portion of ad-supported users into paying Premium subscribers to increase profitability.<br>
Actions:
Introduce limited-time Premium trials.
Offer enhanced features and exclusive content for Premium users.
Collect data to identify high-paying potential among ad-supported users.
- **Cost Structure Analysis (for Olivia, VP of Operations)** 
To address Olivia’s needs, we examine Spotify's cost structure in detail, including Cost of Revenue, Sales & Marketing Expenses, and R&D Costs.
Premium Cost of Revenue stands at $31,176, significantly higher compared to other cost categories.<br>
Recommendations:
Seek more affordable software license models to reduce costs.
Compare providers without compromising service quality.
Consider using open-source software as alternatives to expensive third-party licenses.
For Sales and Marketing costs:
Focus on high-ROI marketing strategies to reduce ineffective advertising spend.
To cut administrative costs:
Implement process automation, such as AI-driven automation in customer support and internal workflows.
