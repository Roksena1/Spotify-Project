# Spotify-Project
## Project Description
Spotify is a leading music streaming service that provides millions of tracks to users worldwide. The company operates with two models: a free model and a premium model, offering both ad-supported and premium subscription services.
## Used Tools (Excel, Tableau)
## The Goal
To provide a comprehensive solution that enables Spotify’s leadership to make informed decisions on revenue growth, user engagement, and cost optimization.
## Key Points and Insights
To meet Mark’s requirements, we created a visualization titled "Change of Total Revenue (Premium Revenue, Profit, etc.) over time." This visualization shows a positive trend over the years.
Total revenue increased from $902 in 2017 to $3,166 in 2023. Premium revenue has also shown a strong positive trend since 2017.
Ad revenue fluctuates the most over the years but still maintains a positive long-term trend.
Ad Cost of Revenue stands at $5,042, directly impacting profitability.
Ad Revenue Efficiency is below 1 in some quarters, such as Q1 2023 (0.97), indicating that costs exceed revenues—therefore, optimization is necessary to achieve positive returns.
- **Recommendations**:
Increase ad frequency (e.g., more ads per hour) without losing users.
Conduct A/B testing to compare longer vs. shorter ads and find optimal formats for revenue growth.
Reduce costs and improve efficiency.
Increase revenue through Premium subscriptions by:
Testing dynamic pricing and adjusting prices based on regions (e.g., lower prices in emerging markets).
Offering longer trial periods for new users (e.g., 3-month free trials for highly engaged segments).
Reducing churn by offering personalized retention campaigns for users at risk of cancellation.
Introducing loyalty programs for long-term subscribers.
